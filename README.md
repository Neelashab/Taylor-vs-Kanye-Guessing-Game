# Taylor-vs-Kanye-Guessing-Game


Instructions to run application: 
1.) After cloning the repo, within the root directory run "npm start" in terminal. This will run the website locally.
2.) Run "node Backend/server.js" to start the backend. 

This project is a React.js based song guessing game. The user interface presents two options, Taylor Swift and Kanye West.
The user selects an artist, and upon the button click a random lyric from that artist is generated. 
The objective is for application to give the user the option to type the name of the song the lyric is from, and the UI will then 
tell the user whether they were correct and keep score of their efforts within a given amount of tries. 

I am currently working on providing this full functionality. For now, there remains a slight disconnect between the frontend and backend.
To still see how they interact, click either Taylor or Kanye and watch the output of the backend produce a random lyric from this artist.
